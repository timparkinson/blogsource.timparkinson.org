## What?

This is not the first time that I've started a blog. Or even the second, or the third. But here we are again. In all honesty I don't expect that anyone will read this but I would like a place in which I can record my thoughts. So here we are.  

I'll hopefully keep a record here of stuff that I'm doing or thinking about or interesting things that I come across. And I'll be fiddling with software, templates and other setup and documenting it - for my own benefit, but it might prove useful to others.

## Who are you?

I live and work in Sheffield in South Yorkshire, UK. I enjoy walking, so it's handy that the [Peak District](https://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/home) is on my doorstep. I enjoy beer and brewing, although I haven't done a lot of the latter in recent times. I'm a music fan and have been known to DJ very occasionally. 

Instead of having an affair or buying a sports car [^car] my midlife crisis seems to be an obsession with [Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay](https://cubicle7games.com/our-games/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay). This is manifesting by buying lots of the rulebooks and reading and [consuming lore](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU87zZ6WGqQLquYdlMZDNMdOiBSK_2Iza). I might even get round to GMing for a group of friends at some point.

At work I'm a senior sysadmin for a university - ostensibly focusing on enterprise storage and compute virtualisation, but with fingers in a lot of other pies.

[^car]: Buying a sports car would be stupid because I don't drive.
