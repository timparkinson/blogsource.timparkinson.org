We recently went to see [Confidence Man](https://www.confidenceman.com.au/) at the [Octagon](https://performancevenues.group.shef.ac.uk/hire-spaces/octagon-centre/), Sheffield. This was a birthday present for my partner's niece - both of whom were blown away by their set at the [Self Esteem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_Esteem_(musician)) curated [Rock N Roll Circus](https://www.rocknrollcircus.co.uk/) last year. 

The support was from [Fcukers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fcukers) who turned in an energetic set that was perfectly pitched to warm the crowd up for the main event. Whilst their track {{< mark >}}Bon Bon{{< /mark>}} has been on regular rotation at Parkinson Manor, I hadn't explored their other stuff. I will be rectifying this.

I can confidently say that Confidence Man know how to put a show on. Whilst the music is banging in it's own right, the excellent visuals (I loved the laser eyed pigeons and smoking badger) and frankly ridiculously energetic choreography elevated it to another level. I'm totally here for the '90s rave vibes that Confidence Man are serving up at the moment - they're definitely wearing their influences on their sleeves. The album title track, {{< mark >}}3AM (LA LA LA){{< /mark >}}, certainly owes a debt to [Orbital's](https://www.orbitalofficial.com/) {{< mark >}}Halcyon{{< /mark >}}, for instance.

The niece left the venue very giddy, and I think we've definitely banked some Aunty & Uncle points.
